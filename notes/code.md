Here is how I code:

Terminal:
I configured my terminal to open my terminal file manager instead of an interactive shell. I can always spawn a shell by pressing `w`, and get back to the file manager with `Ctrl` + `d` (`exit`)

I also configured `lf` to emit OSC-7 escape codes use 

Interactive Shell:
I like the [fish shell](https://fishshell.com). It offers typing suggestions, which `bash` doesn't have. 

Tools:
[aichat](https://github.com/sigoden/aichat) has a terminal integration where I can hit to auto complete commands.

File manager:

Code Editor:

I use [VSCode]()
In the terminal:

Code editor: https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTCoding/comments/1f1es5i/cursor_ai_app_completely_build_using_claude/
[Cursos](https://www.cursor.com)
cursor

I used to use neovim, but got tired of the configuration. I still use it daily as a lightweight text editor from my terminal. It is also worth checking out
